Public complaints about issues like road damage, noise pollution, and vandalism often face delays in resolution due to inefficient complaint management and prioritization. Government agencies struggle to process large volumes of complaints, leading to slow responses and misallocation of resources. Traditional complaint-handling systems lack an effective mechanism to assess the severity and urgency of each issue, resulting in critical problems being overlooked.​

Our team is designing an innovative app for a streamlined and hassle-free posting of public complaints in the form of grievances , redressals and to work upon unwanted carelessness regarding certain issues by the trusted authorities.​
